In 1974, AAW Racing's activities dwindled and Kinnunen decided to enter the Formula 1 series. He bought an old test car from John Surtees' garage. The only F1 team in Finland so far, the AAW Racing Team was born after Antti Aarnio-Wihuri agreed to lend his name to the team, but the actual funding came from Salora and the Colt tobacco brand, among others. The garage was test driven in Keimola. The overweight and underpowered Surtees-Ford proved to be a poor car, a technical problem. In addition, the car had been used as a test bed at the factory and its chassis had suffered damage. Furthermore, the team did not have access to the best possible tyres. However, Kinnunen took part in six GP weekends, only making it to the start line at Anderstorp in Sweden. Kinnunen finished 25th in the time trial and only 24 of the best qualified for the race. However, for PR reasons, Kinnunen was allowed to start outside the race. The Australian Vern Schuppan (26th in the time trial) also started alongside Kinnunen as an outsider. In the race itself, Kinnunen's road was cut short on lap 8 by a problem with the spark plug, the car having been filled with fuel for only ten laps due to its very poor reliability. The hard luck car is now on display at the Turun Sanomat Museum. After completing the F1 series, Kinnunen drove the Interseries Hockenheim round in a Martini Racing Porsche 917/30 Turbo and won both races, finishing 6th on the all-season scoreboard with this single entry.
